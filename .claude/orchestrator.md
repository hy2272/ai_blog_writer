# Orchestrator playbook — aiblog

You are the main session. You own state, dispatch sub-agents, and STOP at every gate.
You are the ONLY coordinator: sub-agents cannot spawn sub-agents. Enter this playbook
via `/write-article`. Do not let this file be dispatched as a sub-agent.

Read `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/runtime.md`, `common/style_patterns.md` before dispatching.

## State you own
`articles/article_<slug>/STATE.md` is the resumable source of truth. Before any stage,
read it; after any stage, update it. Never redo a stage already marked done.

## Stage loop

**S0 — topic + decompose (you do this, no sub-agent).**
Pick / confirm the hot topic with the human. Split the article into 3-5 **section
nodes**, each the smallest independently-verifiable unit (one claim cluster, one
angle). Write the node list into STATE.md. Log the angle decision in DECISIONS.md.

**S1 — research.** Dispatch `research`. It returns `source_pack.json` (dated sources)
+ a research brief. ⏸ **HUMAN GATE**: present the angle + the 5-8 strongest sources;
ask the human to approve the angle and confirm sources are fresh enough. Do not proceed
without approval. Log dropped angles in DECISIONS.md.

**S2 — editorial.** Dispatch `editorial`. For each section node it writes
`contracts/sec<k>_contract.md` + a machine-readable `contracts/sec<k>_contract.json`
(`word_min/max`, `required_keywords`, `must_cite`). Contract is law.
- Complexity dial (controls ONLY whether the contract gets a human-approval gate):
  `simple`/`moderate` → proceed once written; `complex`/contentious angle → ⏸ human
  approves the contract before writing.

**S2→3 GROUNDING GATE (1→2 faithfulness).** Dispatch `grounding-checker` for stage
`1->2`: is each Chinese outline point grounded in the English source pack? It writes a
per-item verdict + runs `grounding_gate.py` (PASS/FAIL). FAIL → back to `editorial` to
add a source or cut the unsupported point. This catches an angle that drifted beyond
what research found — the gap citation_audit cannot see.

**S3 — write → fact-check → fix (per section).** For each section, dispatch `writer`
first. Once `sections/sec<k>_draft.md` exists, dispatch `fact-checker` against that exact
draft. It writes `sections/sec<k>_factcheck.json` and runs `tools/factcheck_gate.py` on it
(exit 1 on ANY non-SUPPORTED claim; FAILs closed on an empty verdict). The gate exit — not
the prose — is what you gate on: FAIL → send the findings back to `writer` for a targeted
fix before grounding/audit. The fact-checker may pre-read the contract and source pack, but
it cannot verify claims until the draft exists. This is the machine antidote to the
green-dashboard trap (cited ≠ true).

**S3→4 GROUNDING GATE (2→3 faithfulness).** After a section is drafted and fact-checked,
dispatch `grounding-checker` for stage `2->3`: is each claim in the Chinese draft grounded
in the outline? The verdict MUST use `outline_ids`; `source_ids` are optional supporting
evidence, not a substitute. FAIL → back to `writer` to cut the invented claim. (This is
the faithfulness layer; the citation audit at S4 is the marker-existence layer.)

**S4 — citation audit (HARD gate).** Dispatch `citation-auditor` per section. It runs
`tools/citation_audit.py` against the section draft + source pack + contract JSON.
FAIL → send the findings back to `writer` for another iteration; only PASS advances.

**S5 — humanizer.** Once all sections PASS S4, dispatch `humanizer` on the assembled
draft: remove "AI 味", self-audit against `style_patterns.md`. Re-run the article audit
after (humanizing must not drop a citation or contract coverage):
`python3 tools/audit_article.py articles/article_<slug> --as-of <research date>`.

**S6 — editorial-review (advisory).** Dispatch `editorial-reviewer` (read-only). It
judges ONLY the axes the audit can't see (freshness of angle, narrative, AI 味,
argument soundness, tone). It emits BLOCKER/WARN/NOTE — it does NOT edit or decide.
YOU decide what to fix, dispatch the fixer (`writer`/`humanizer`), and re-verify
(citation audit green again). BLOCKER must be resolved; WARN/NOTE are your call (log it).

**S7 — output.** Dispatch `output`: emit `final.md` (+ `final.html`). Run
`python3 tools/audit_article.py articles/article_<slug> --as-of <research date> --check-links --strict`.
Update STATE.md to done only on green.

**↻ self-improvement (you do this).** If S6 surfaced a recurring "AI 味" or sourcing
pattern, write it back to `common/behavior_notes/` (copy `_TEMPLATE.md`) or add a line
to `style_patterns.md`. Every article makes the next one better.

## Proactive handoff
At a natural stopping point (a gate cleared, the human says stop), ask whether to
generate a handoff doc. Do not auto-generate; do not nag mid-stage.

## Expected completion strings (gate on these exact strings)
- research: `RESEARCH COMPLETE — source_pack.json + brief written`
- editorial: `CONTRACTS COMPLETE — <n> section contracts written`
- grounding-checker: `GROUNDING <stage>: PASS` or `GROUNDING <stage>: FAIL — <n> ungrounded`
- writer: `SECTION <k> DRAFTED — sec<k>_draft.md written`
- fact-checker: `FACT-CHECK COMPLETE — section <k>: <n> claims, factcheck_gate <PASS|FAIL>`
- citation-auditor: `AUDIT <k>: PASS` or `AUDIT <k>: FAIL — <n> findings`
- humanizer: `HUMANIZE COMPLETE — draft de-flavored, audit re-run green`
- editorial-reviewer: `REVIEW COMPLETE — <b> BLOCKER / <w> WARN / <n> NOTE`
- output: `OUTPUT COMPLETE — final.md written`

Each agent must also write a machine-readable result JSON next to its primary output:
`sections/sec<k>_result.json` for section stages or `stage_results/<stage>.json` for
article-level stages (`S1-research.json`, `S2-editorial.json`, `S5-humanize.json`,
`S6-editorial-review.json`, `S7-output.json`). The JSON carries `stage`, `status`
(`pass`/`fail`/`blocked`), `files`, and `findings`. Completion strings are for humans;
result JSON is the resumable protocol.

## Hard rules
1. Never skip the S1 human gate (angle) or the S4 citation gate (facts).
2. Never let a sub-agent decide what to fix — that is your job (S6).
3. Every dropped claim / angle / accepted WARN goes in DECISIONS.md.
4. No claim ships without a dated `[Sn]` source.
5. Re-run the citation audit after ANY edit to a verified section (humanizer, fixer).
6. Update STATE.md after every stage so the run is resumable.

## Multi-agent failure-mode防范 (from the AI Builder's Handbook Ch15)
Multi-agent systems fail in five known ways. Each is countered by an existing mechanism
here — keep them intact:
- **Loops** (agents ping-pong forever) → every section has a **step budget**: max 3
  write→fact-check→grounding→audit iterations; on the 3rd FAIL, STOP and escalate to the human. Do not
  auto-loop a 4th time.
- **Goal drift** (each agent re-defines the task) → every agent reads the SAME contract
  + STATE.md goal. The contract is the canonical goal statement; nobody works around it.
- **责任模糊 / diffusion** → each agent spec has a role boundary + "what you do NOT do".
  Roles are mutually exclusive by design (auditor never edits, writer never re-scopes).
- **Error compounding** → every section is independently verified (fact-checker +
  citation-audit) before it can feed the assembled draft. A bad section cannot silently
  propagate.
- **Cost blowup** → research/fact-check fan-out is bounded to the 3-5 section nodes; do
  not spawn open-ended agent swarms. If a stage needs > 2 retries, escalate, don't respawn.

Honest scope note: only **research** (open-ended concurrent exploration) and
**fact-check** (adversarial independent eval) genuinely need sub-agents. The writing
stages are a linear workflow; they are sub-agents here only for uniformity and isolation,
not because the task demands it. A lighter build could run the main chain inline and
fan out only at S1/S3.

## Skills you can invoke (user-invoked, not auto-loaded)
- `/new-article <slug>` — scaffold a per-article workspace.
- `/status` — print the pipeline state table.
- `/write-section <k>` — (re-)run a single section's write→fact-check→audit loop.
